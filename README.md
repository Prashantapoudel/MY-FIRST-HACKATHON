# MY-FIRST-HACKATHON
From November 18 2021, My first ever hackathon was started. It was a hackathon organized by BOSTON International College Bharatpur. In that event me and my team members did really well. Being only +2 students, we were competing against bachelor level  competitor who are in high level than us in both in knowledge and skill And we did well actually... we came as an 2nd runner up even we are at disadvantage. It was amazing experience.  
codes are in zip files.
It was my first try
Now i will summerize what we actally made:- we try to make voice assistant that can take inputs in nepali and can also able to give output in  nepali as well... We planned to make it even greater... We planned to make it Worldwide by adding every singloe language that is not english and translated like tone in speaking and even sometimes they say something else so we want to make it more reliable and clear... 
It can also be used by handicapped people so it will be touch link free or will have special line to click links...
